nesRF is a project to retrofit wireless capability into otherwise standard
NES and SNES video game controllers.  It is both hardware (schematic and PCB)
and software (running on an ATMega microcontroller).

The primary goals are:

* Clean design.  External appearance should be minimal, with few visible
  changes from the original stock hardware, besides removing the wire.
* Cross-compatibility: especially, the SNES controller will co-operate with
  either the SNES or NES receiver.
