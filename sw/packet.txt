The RF packet format is two bytes, sixteen bits.  A button HIGH means it is
_not_ pressed.  This is both the value we will read directly, given a pullup
input, and the value that we must send to the console.

The sixteen bits are, most to least significant order:

F  Battery status.  0 = healthy, 1 = low
E  Sleeping status.  0 = normal, 1 = transmitter is sleeping
D  Undefined, reserved for future use.
C  Undefined, reserved for future use.
B  Button data, R.
A  Button data, L.
9  Button data, X.
8  Button data, A.
7  Button data, Right.
6  Button data, Left.
5  Button data, Down.
4  Button data, Up.
3  Button data, Start.
2  Button data, Select.
1  Button data, Y.
0  Button data, B.

The button data is arranged so that it can be right-shifted out, and the
least significant bit is always the next value that the console needs.
